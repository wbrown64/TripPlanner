TripCo Team 25

Usage: Run TripCo.java <inputfilename.csv> <mapbackground.svg> [-m -n -i or -g for GUI] to produce <inputfilename.xml> and <inputfilename.svg> and optional GUI

Purpose: The program is intended for mapping trips across Colorado. When given a csv file containing a list of locations to visit,
the program will generate an svg image displaying the route for the trip, as well as an xml file with details about the journey. A GUI display is another
option if the user would like it to be displayed. When given a svg file, the program will display the Colorado map in the background
giving users a better idea of where they are in Colorado. 
The -m flag will add mileage to the svg display
The -n flag adds the names of locations to the map
The -i flag displays the indices of each location on the map
The -g flag displays the GUI where the user can pick and choose what to display

Issue summary: Save/loading destinations along with subset and 3opt.

Notes: This program was made while using Git and Eclipse
