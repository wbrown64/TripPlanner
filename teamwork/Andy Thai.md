Personality type: ENTJ

1. My expectations for what my team will accomplish this semester is being able to work cooperatively together, communicate very well, and develop team working skills that other projects/classes were not able to offer.

2. My personal goals for improving my team work and communication skills this semester is to take assignments seriously and to always accomplish weekly goals we set as a team.

3. The kind of obstacles I might encounter when trying to reach team and personal goals are our everyday lives. Each of us have different things going on in our lives everyday and sometimes unplanned events comes up and we might fall behind but that is okay because we have to put in extra work the next day.

4. I think its important for everyone to strive for an "A" that way we establish a uniform goal for the semester but its not the end of the world if we end up getting a "B".

5. I don't think its acceptable for one team member to do more work for others in order to get an "A". Each and everyone of us should put in equal amounts of work and hold each other accountable to do our necessary work load.

6. I think it could range each week but on average if I were to guess probably about 10 hours.

7. How we would decide who should do what on each activity is look at each others skills and personal strengths. We should do activities that cater to our strengths to maximize our efficiency.

8. If someone were to miss a deadline I would hope that person communicates effectively to the rest of the group so that everyone is on the same page to either help that person meet their deadline or figure out a way to make up for that missed deadline together.

9. If people have different opinions on the work, I think we should all come together and decide on the best approach for the good of the overall team grade.

10. Everyone has different work habits, its just a matter of maximizing each group member's strengths and making sure the weekly task gets accomplish. I don't think work habits will be much of a problem.

11. I would prefer to have a meeting time every week outside of class depending on everyone's schedules.

12. I think the team needs to meet at least twice a week outside of class so that everyone is kept in the loop on where we stand as far as progress.

13. I think its important to get everyone's opinion and ideas on a decision before making one final decision. 

14. If everyone except one person agrees on something I think its important to talk as a group and listen to each other for whats best for the group overall.

15. We can rotate the facilitator position after every time our deadline is due.

16. If one person seems to be dominating the team process I think its important for everyone to at least try to put in the same amount of work evenly.

17. If I feel like most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on me I would bring it up at the next group meet and discuss different ways to share the work load evenly.

18. It generally easiest to reach me by text at pretty much an hours everyday.
