1.What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?

We will learn to work as a team through working on the main project

2.What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?

I hope to learn how to express ideas to others more effectively, as well as improve my code documentation

3.What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?

I often forget to make my voice heard in a group setting

4.What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?

The "A" members must encourage "B" members to strive for an A, at least for the sake of self improvement made in one's skillset by doing so

5.Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?

Yes, although less than ideal

6.How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?

6-8 hours

7.How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?

At least at first, have whoever came up with the idea for a component of the project be the first one to work on it. From there, rotate to make sure we all understand it

8.What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?

Attempt to pick up the slack, but try to resolve the issue as quickly as possible

9.What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?

Verify quality through testing, if it works but is sluggish, check if there is time to improve. If the work does not function as designed, fix it

10.How will you deal with different work habits of team members?

Attempt to accommodate, attempt to work together when relavent

11.Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?

Yes

12.How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?

Twice a week, three times if having difficulties with something

13.Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?

3/4 minimum consensus, but unanimous on bigger decisions

14.What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?

If it's a minor decision, go for it (UI placement and such). If it's a more significant factor in the long term project design, we should try to reach a full agreement

15.How often will you rotate the facilitator position?  How will you decide on whose turn it is to facilitate?

Either rotate per meeting or per idea (depends on how modular the design becomes)

16.What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?

Encourage other members to speak up more (or try to do so myself)

17.What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?

Try to ask questions of the other members to make sure their input is heard still

18.Is it generally easier to reach you by text, email, vmail or something else?  What hours?

Text is faster, although I feel email suits this kind of environment more (long descriptions of what's going on and all). Either one should be able to get a hold of me in the evening all week and afternoons on weekends (work+classes during the week still allow for communication but not necessarily swift responses)
