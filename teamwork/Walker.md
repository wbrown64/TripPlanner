1)I expect to complete all assignments, and to do well on all of them.  All the while exploring the new techniques that are being presented to us in class.  

2)Flexibility, I aim to be comfortable working with people from a distance, and coordinating hours and work in a way that works for everyone.  

3)At some point, it may be noticed that we're falling behind, in which case I would start to ask that we all contribute more, and may be a little less flexible with hour hours of operation.  

4) I think the two sides should talk about it, and about what would need to be done in order to obtain an A. 

5)Although I'm not entirely opposed to it, I do not think it is very fair to have some people do other team members work in order to get a good grade. 

6)  Although I do not know the assignments, I feel like 3-4 hours a week each should be plenty of time.  

7)I think we should all talk about and coordinate our strengths and weaknesses, as well as what we like to work on normally. 

8)See why the deadline was missed, and make sure we can catch up what was lost.  If it becomes a problem, I would look to the rest of the group members to feel out the situation.  

9)We should talk about why a certain piece of work is or isn't, quality.  Looking to the rest of the team to decide if more work needs to be done or not.  

10)By understanding these habits early on, in order to plan ahead and around any problem times.  

11)  I feel like a once a week, 30-1 hour long meeting couldn't hurt.  We could be flexible about it too, in case someone is swamped for time or anything along those lines.  

12)  Again, once a week sounds good.  I think this very much depends on the workload and our ability to get work done.  

13) Big decisions, yes.  Smaller ones, not really.  

14)  Everyone should talk about the dispute, and be open to others feelings and needs.  But, majority rules IMO. 

15)If everyones cool with it, maybe never?  I think if someone is good at keeping the process moving, they should keep doing it.  

16)Let them know of your concern, and see what the other team members have to say about that claim.  If needed, have a group wide discussion about the matter. 

17) Let the group know, and ask that they help out in order to meet deadlines.  

18)  I check my rams email constantly during the day, and have my phone on me at almost all times.  Feel free to contact me 24/7, though I may be slightly slow on the response during the day.
