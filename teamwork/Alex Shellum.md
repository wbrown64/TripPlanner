Personality type: INFP

1. We have four people, so I expect to get an A in this class. I also expect to learn more about working as a team and that we all work hard for the good of the group.

2. I get a little stubborn with my code, I have a hard time thinking that the way someone else discusses to solve a problem is better than mine. I want to try and kick that habit.

3. We'll probably but heads a little. I feel like we haven't worked in groups much and we're all going to think that our way is best.

4. It's hard to force someone to want an A, if they want to put in a "B" level of work, then we'll work around it.

5. Absolutely.

6. It's hard to say at this point, I haven't seen the project yet.

7. Assuming everyone has a relatively similar schedule, we should be able to just grab something out of the box and start working on it.

8. Two options: we will tie cinder blocks to their ankles and toss them into the ocean, or we'll sit down, talk about why it happened, and how to avoid it next time.

9. We can talk it over, see what they think needs changing, and discuss it as a group either in person or over voice-chat.

10. If it doesn't cause a problem for the group, then I don't think we need to get on them. If it puts more work on the rest of us though, we'll have to sit down and talk about it.

11. Yes, 4 on Mondays.

12. Weekly.

13. Absolutely, at least until we grow more as a team. We can revisit the issue then.

14. I'd like to have unanimous votes eventually, but realistically, I think it's going to have to be majority for a while.

15. I would like to do it where every project has a new facilitator.

16. We get together and talk it out, maybe make them take a backseat for the next one.

17. It depends on how intensive it's going to end up being. if it isn't that much work I won't be that upset. If it is though, I'll ask somebody else to step up next time.

18. Text from 9am - 8pm.
